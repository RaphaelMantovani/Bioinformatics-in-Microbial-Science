Here are some of the analyses I did for the Suen Lab at the University of Wisconsin. This study intends to analyze correlation between cow genes and their milk production efficiency. With the R code above I separated cows in high, mid, and low effiency based on their RFI and the standard deviations they are from the line of regression. I also cleaned the data and analyzed the alpha and beta diversity we had in our data. Visualizations are as follow:
